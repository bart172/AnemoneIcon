# What is this
This is the original icon for the Anemone theming engine. Made on July 12, 2015.
Those files are aimed for those who want to adapt, or "theme" Anemone, and get the style right. Or perhaps to those who are too lazy to recreate the icon from scratch.

# Terms of Use
You can use and modify this icon as you please, but you I'd be glad if you could mention me somewhere in your work if you do so.
I, however, own the rights to the original design and the source files. You *must* ask for permission if you intend to use the files without modifications for anything that is not a personal project.
